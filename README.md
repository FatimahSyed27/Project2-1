New Website found here: https://project2roblesschatzsyed.github.io/Project2/
portfolio: https://project2roblesschatzsyed.github.io/Project2/portfolio.html

Page 1: Home Page 

Currently: No structure beyond categorization of content. Although ironic in an artistic sense, the page is difficult to navigate and largely dysfunctional. Proposed layout follows a modernized newspaper-like “feel” as a notion to Ripps’ writing background, while maintaining a more current portfolio site.  
Black Banner/white text heading with name & title to the left
Right side of banner is navigation; Home, About, Portfolio, Socials/Contact
NYTimes image across page

Page 2: About

Currently: No specific “about” page, large links at the top, lack format, and no color scheme. The author’s name is in a small font towards the corner left of the page and is barely visible by the large instagram portfolio links below it.    
Repeat heading/navigation banner at top
Main body: white background/black text
Author’s name and info
General summary of experience and work
Image of portrait 

Page 3: Portfolio (showcase pieces)

Currently there is no portfolio page to display artwork and work, links to the work do not showcase or explain or introduce the various works they have done. The new portfolio section will link to many different content pages each consisting of links, info, art and more. Structure will be used to make the site easy to follow and near every link or redirect will be an image or various media showcasing what is there.
Same black banner as the home page with a more structured layout
Link to categories as content pages
Incorporated pics of artwork related to each category below or to the side
A simple structured styling will let the artwork and the links pop.
All images and links will have ample margins to give room to breath


Page 4: Socials & Contact me

Currently, there is no socials or contact page; everything is linked at the bottom with no specific layout. We need to make sure the layout is intuitive, so users can easily find what they are looking for. We can use visual hierarchy to arrange the headings in order and guide the user's eye through the website.
We will have the author’s instagram and twitter handles along with some recent pictures from his socials. Below that we will have a separate section for his contact information i.e. email address and C.V. 
The twitter and instagram links are all in the same font and color. We will improve the typography by using appropriate font sizes, styles, and line spacing to make the text more visually appealing. 
We need to add appropriate margins and use the whitespace to add a clean, uncluttered look rather than an empty, plain look. 
This will also include a process page: “here’s how you can contact me” sign-up form.   It will request a name, email address, location, message type (drop down tab for requests, queries, and commissions) and a large text pane that the users filled in with their message. A submit button will be below to complete the request and reload the page.
